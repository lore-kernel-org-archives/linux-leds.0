True, but that doesn't mean to not copy us. If we didn't want to be
copied, we would update MAINTAINERS.

I wouldn't call this one an individual driver either. This is very
much a generic binding which we do want to review.

You have the node the "leds" phandle points to which is the actual LED
device and then this node which is just backlight properties. And then
presumably another phandle in the panel device to point to the
backlight device.

Okay, it wasn't clear that leds points to the LED controller node. The
example made it seem as it was the device. We already have a way to
describe LEDs and that is as child nodes of the LED controller node.
Please follow what was done for flash LEDs (leds/common.txt).

What's wrong with the existing pwm-backlight binding in the PWM case?

A more complete example would be helpful here.
