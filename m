In this case, it will go with the settings for 'bar'. I didn't check for
the conflicting settings since I was going for consistency with the
other two backlight drivers that already have the led-sources property:
arcxcnn_bl.c and sky81452-backlight.c. I can add the additional check
to fail if a source has already been encountered.

OK... I can fix that up plus your other two comments.
