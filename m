Changing the internal implementation has never been the goal of this
patch. As explained in the commit log, I'm just renaming the function
to make it consistent with other fwnode functions (as suggested by
Linus).
What's happening here is exactly the kind of discussion I wanted to
avoid, and the reason I decided to not change the
devm_get_gpiod_from_child() prototype/name in the first place.

Linus, is this something you really care about? If that's the case, can
you step in?
