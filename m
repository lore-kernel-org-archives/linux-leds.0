Well, LED transient trigger can be activated like that. But that will
not work on any hardware currently supported by the mainline kernel.

Equivalent command with forcefeedback is:

(echo 5; sleep 1; echo -1) | sudo fftest /dev/input/event2

You would not want to use either in production.

I would like to see reasonable explanation why we want 1. (and
vibrations are not that) and certainly 2. because we don't want people
to use LED subsystem for vibrations.

We already have perfectly good interface for that.
