Sorry, I'm just too stressed by all patches. I now read back on the

Yeah.

But that is just insane. Then it is just better to apply this and the
other patch making the situation manageable.

This is a good time to do it too since I'm anyways patching around
in all the consumers this merge window.

Dmitry: is this such a big deal to you?

commit 40b7318319281b1bdec804f6435f26cadd329c13
"gpio: Support for unified device properties interface"

by Mika Westerberg introduced

fwnode_get_named_gpiod()
devm_get_gpiod_from_child()

Both are taking a fwnode as argument and the naming is as
inconsistent as it can be.

Some more churn should be expected as a side
effect of naming this function wrong in the first place.
The fwnode API change was on fast-forward and mistakes
were made, also by me, mea culpa.

When I write kernel code, I usually intuitively look for a function doing
what I want, this naming is unintuitive, and it has confused me so
it will confuse others.

Can I please apply these two patches?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
