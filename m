Yeah, you're right. That is probably the best way to handle this.

Janne, could you send two separate patches on top of v9 that fixes the
use-before-initialisation (reported by Oliver) and moves the led_mode
attribute from the parent HID device to the led-class devices (thereby
fixing the race reported by Greg)?

As the "led_"-prefix will then be redundant, you should probably rename
the attribute as "msi_mode" or similar (just "mode" might be too
generic).

Remember to update the ABI documentation as well, including mentioning
the fact that changing the mode of one LED will update the mode of its
two sibling devices as well (as suggested by Bj=F8rn).

Thanks,
Johan
