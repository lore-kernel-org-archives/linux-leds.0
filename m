We're writing over 32 bits of a long.  It's a dangerous habbit.

If long is u32 then of_property_read_u32_index() works, obviously.  If
it is a little endian and the last 32 bits have been zeroed out (as they
have been here) then that also works.

If it's big endian and 64 bit then it doesn't work because we're writing
to the wrong 32 bits.
