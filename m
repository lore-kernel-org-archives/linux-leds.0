I understand that period of TLC chip cannot be changed and hence cannot
fully implement PWM interface. But, suppose I want to control brightness
of an LCD screen, with your current design, my LCD driver can never can do
something like:
	pwm_get(chip);
	pwm_update_brightness();
	pwm_remove();
I will always have to rely on sysfs entries to control brightness.
 
If the driver is implemented as pwm-backlight, then brightness can
be controlled both via sysfs entries and pwm-core callbacks(in kernel).

But, as far as I understand, leds-pwm.c does almost similar function.
