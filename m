I was telling Shuah 5 years ago that using LED for what she wanted was
not the right idea. I even made a patch for her implementing the
functionality they were after: https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/4/10/41

Unfortunately this still somehow made it into the kernel. I guess the
angle of having LEDs auto-shutoff makes sense still; using it for
haptics does not.

No, we are discussing if it makes sense encouraging 2nd interface for
haptic. We are also discussing whether it makes sense to implement new
features in LED subsystem that seem to be only beneficial for this
interface (I assume the "normal" LEDs do not need that kind of
precision?).

Having the wording in documentation does not in any way stops Android
folks from continuing [ab]using the transient trigger. But this is
their choice. The purpose of documentation is to document the best
practices, not all possible crazy solutions one can come up with.

Thanks.
