short version: I have a use case for leds where I want to be able to use 
the triggers in the leds subsystem without having a physical hardware led.

long version: I am working on a program to make one embedded system 
(http://fatcatlab.com/product/evb/) compatible with another 
(http://mindstorms.lego.com). One has physical red/green LEDs, that use 
the gpio leds driver to control them. The other system does not have 
physical leds. However, it does have a color screen. So, my idea is
to create virtual LEDs on the screen that emulate the physical LEDs on 
the other device.

I would like to make a userspace program that works the same on both 
devices. If the leds were simple on-off, then it would of course be 
simpler to make the virtual leds completely in userspace. However, we 
are currently using other triggers (disk activity/heatbeat/etc.) with 
the leds. I would like for the virtual LEDs to be able to use these 
triggers as well.


Proposed implementation:

My thought is to create a new module that can be used to create 
user-defined leds using configfs. Below is some sample code that I have 
been experimenting with. Be aware, it does not quite match the 
description I am about to give.

In configfs you simply create a new node for each leds and assign the 
name. We could have separate attributes for devicename, color and 
function to enforce the naming convention or we could just allow 
arbitrary names.

Once the leds class devices are configured in configfs and exported, it 
will create the usual leds class device in sysfs as well as a character 
device that can be polled by the userspace program. The character device 
would work a bit like evdev where any time the brightness is changed, it 
spits out an event on the character device.

It would probably be simplest to have a single character device for all 
virtual leds. In this case the leds device name or some other id would 
need to be part of the event structure.

Any thoughts? Does this seem like a sane thing to do? Or maybe there is 
a different way to accomplish the same thing using existing drivers?
