Hi David,

One has physical red/green LEDs, that use the gpio leds driver to control them. The other system does not have physical leds. However, it does have a color screen. So, my idea is

However, we are currently using other triggers (disk activity/heatbeat/etc.) with the leds. I would like for the virtual LEDs to be able to use these triggers as well.

this is funny since I have just written a ledsim.c using debugfs to emulate a LED and read out its state via a simple cat command. I found that useful for testing triggers in the Bluetooth subsystem and see if they behave correctly without bothering to run this on real hardware.

So I used debugfs since I was lazy and only needed it for testing. However doing something similar to what /dev/uinput, /dev/uhid, /dev/rfkill, /dev/vhci etc. are doing seems to be reasonable here. What I like with these userspace driven interfaces is that the process has to keep the character device open. Once it closes it, then the kernel removes the data structures. So I would vote for creating a /dev/uled.

However creating /dev/uled would lead to using a dedicated tool to drive it. Which might be useful anyway since it could be easily extended with some easy to use functionality for testing purposes. It would also be simple to create unit test integration.

For my test of ledsim.c I opted for debugfs and cat just so that I can do it really easily. I can share my code if that is interesting to people.

Regards

Marcel
