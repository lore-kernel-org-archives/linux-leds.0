You do not need it, it will just reduce size of the patch if you use
it. I'd be perfectly fine not with having it and have everything in
fwnode_get_named_gpiod().

devm_get_gpiod_from_child() tries to apply "-gpio" and "-gpios" suffixes
to the supplied GPIO ID while current fwnode_get_named_gpiod() takes
property name literally.
