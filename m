OK, so I agree that the most proper fix to the discussed problem
would be ignoring brightness setting requests after suspend, as Pavel
suggested.

led_classdev_suspend() already turns the LED off and
led_classdev_resume() brings the brightness back.

Also led_set_brightness_nosleep() and led_set_brightness_sync()
don't propagate brightness change to the driver if LED_SUSPENDED
is set.

There are two problems though:
1. __led_set_brightness() and __led_set_brightness_blocking() don't
   check the flag, and they can be called from set_brightness_delayed(),
   that was already queued at the time of setting LED_SUSPENDED flag.
2. LED_SUSPENDED flag is accessed in a non-atomic way.

The solution as I see it would be respectively:
1. Return from __led_set_brightness() and
   __led_set_brightness_blocking() if LED_SUSPENDED is set.
2. Switch to accessing struct led_classdev's flags with use of
   bitops. Fortunately those flags are mainly set prior LED class
   device registration and only LED_SYSFS_DISABLE, LED_SUSPENDED
   and LED_UNREGISTERING are accessed afterwards, and only in the LED
   core, so only those places would have to be modified.

Best regards,
Jacek Anaszewski
