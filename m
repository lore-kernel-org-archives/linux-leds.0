This state has lasted for five years now. I don't recall any
complaints. Do you?

It seems that you applied a fait accompli method here.

Actually could you share what the decision is? AFAIK we're not
discussing here any patch for the input subsystem?

You cut off important piece of my text from the beginning of this
paragraph. It was:

What I meant is that it is my decision, as a LED subsystem maintainer,
to accept the addition of a note about some other subsystem offering
an equivalent or even better substitute of the feature being available
in the subsystem I am responsible for. And I will accept such a patch
only if mentioned conditions are met.
