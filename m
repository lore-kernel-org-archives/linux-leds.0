No, only LEDs.

That sounds sensible. led-backlight seems to be mostly implemented
already via the led trigger code. Adding a minimal backlight_ops does
not look too hard. You might also be able to do some cleanup of the
other led based backlight drivers. 

led-gpio looks like more work, but i don't see why it should not be
possible. One thing i do need to check is that if the brightness is
set to 255 the output is not set to 255/256 on and you have a regular
glitch. For an LED that does not really matter, but for GPIO it would
not be good.
