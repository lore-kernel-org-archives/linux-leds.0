Hi Simon

Hard one. I also have a driver stuck in led limbo.

Last time we took a fix via mvebu, it all went messy at the last
minute. We made it very clear to Bryon we planned to take a patch via
mvebu, we had queued it via mvebu, we had sent a pull request to
arm-soc, all with no reply from Bryon. Only at the last minute did he
jump in, pull it himself and send it to Linus. That caused Olof all
sorts of problems with his tree.

To stop that happening again, i think we need an Acked-by from Bryan.
