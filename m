Ick, no.  Wait, I wrote this?  Oh yeah, no, just delete it, and use your
new version instead.  No need to preserve this bizarre one-off api for
any reason, I don't think anyone uses it.  The device I had is
long-gone.  If anyone objects after we remove it, we can think about
adding it back, but for now, let's just delete it.
