Some time ago I was trying to add common LEDs DT properties that would
have defined brightness in levels, but other people insisted on
microamperes [1]. The discussion was focused on flash LEDs, where
currents are significantly greater and there is risk of hardware
damage in case underrated LED is connected [2]. Having the property in
microamperes removes the need for consulting documentation to check
current value for given brightness level.

As it was mentioned earlier in this thread, this approach is not
suitable for PWM driven leds, and they have their own bindings,
which allow for describing brightness in levels. Probably we
should add some note to the common LEDs DT bindings that would
state explicitly that such exceptions are allowed.

In case of backlights which are built upon LED class devices we could
stick to brightness levels, as a LED class driver will assert
brightness level to the leds-max-microamp value anyway.
