Right, but what I meant is that the max current is applied to the LED
controller hardware, so in that sense it can be considered as a property
of the LED controller.

If there was, say, a flash that supports changing the color of the
light, that property would be applied to the flash HW so it'd be a
property of the "other end".

I like the GPIO/PWM binding model, as it doesn't force any
node-hierarchy to the consumer of the GPIO/PWM. I don't see LED
controller output being any different than PWM, but the current LED
bindings still force the consumers of the LED signal to be a child of
the LED controller.

How about an LCD module, controlled via i2c, which takes a LED PWM
signal as an input, but needs i2c commands to enable the actual
backlight? So kind of i2c controlled smart LED. Or if the LCD module
takes two LED PWM signal inputs to achieve some fancy backlight effects.

Yes, it's theoretical HW, and I know some people don't like to discuss
such things... But the above example is easily accomplished with the
GPIO/PWM style bindings, but I don't have any idea how it could be done
with the current LED bindings.

There's something a bit more complex there. The gpio controls TI
TPS6108x (http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps61081.pdf "High-Voltage
DC-DC Boost Converter").

But possibly all that can still be considered as you described.

True. But on the other hand I would also not want to force new drivers
to use the current binding model, if it doesn't quite fit.

So if the PWM/GPIO model is fine, and LED controllers are really very
similar, shouldn't we extend the LED bindings towards PWM/GPIO model
rather than trying to fit everything into the current LED bindings?

Of course, even if everybody would agree with the above, this particular
backlight binding is rather simple, and I think we can fit it in the
current model. But that then raises the question, if led-backlight and
pwm-backlight are about the same, why are the binding model different.

In my experience, the relationship between the nodes is usually the most
difficult part with bindings, both in the design side and the driver
implementation side.

So if pwm-backlight links to the pwm source using a phandle, and
led-backlight links by child-parent relationship, I see them as quite
different, even if the rest of the properties are the same.

So hmm... You mean using the pwm-backlight node, without the "pwms"
property, as the source is implicit? So:

/* tlc59108 is an i2c device */
tlc59116@40 {
	#address-cells =3D <1>;
	#size-cells =3D <0>;
	compatible =3D "ti,tlc59108";
	reg =3D <0x40>;

	wan@0 {
		label =3D "wrt1900ac:amber:wan";
		reg =3D <0x0>;
	};

	bl@2 {
		label =3D "backlight";
		reg =3D <0x2>;

		compatible =3D "led-backlight";
		brightness-levels =3D <0 243 245 247 248 249 251 252 255>;
		default-brightness-level =3D <8>;

		enable-gpios =3D <&pcf_lcd 13 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};
};

At the moment each LED controller driver does its own DT parsing, and
there's no common code for anything related to DT in the LED framework
and the LED framework is not even aware of DT nodes or such (which is
why I needed a bit hackish approach in my patches to find the nodes).

I have a gut feeling that going into this direction will require quite a
bit of restructuring in the LED drivers, so I think I need to leave this
task for others due to lack of time.

That is probably a good idea.

I guess one option would also be to create an MFD of the LED controller,
so that it would offer some of the outputs as plain PWMs. Then
pwm-backlight could be used directly.
