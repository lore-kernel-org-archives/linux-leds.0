Sorry for forcing your hand like this, but this is the kind of
discussion I'm not comfortable with (when I need to argue on something
I'm not completely convinced of, or I don't have opinion on).

Indeed, a new function is added (see patch 2), and this new function is
taking an additional 'index' parameter. If that's a problem, I can also
change the prototype of devm_get_gpiod_from_child() and patch all
existing users of this function, but I fear we'll end up with pretty
much the same discussion :-/.

I can still name the new function as you suggested
(devm_fwnode_get_index_gpiod_from_child()), and keep the existing one
unchanged if you want.

Just let me know what you prefer.

Thanks,

Boris
