There's still room to extend it though.

The child nodes are supposed to be the other end. In the flash case,
the properties are constraints on the flash LED (i.e. different flash
LEDs will have different max currents).

I would say backlights are a complex example of LEDs. Of course, there
are backlights not based on LEDs, but we're not talking about those
here.

The GPIO is probably controlling a transistor to connect the LED anode
to ground and therefore turn it on. These have nothing to do with
backlights really, but really are common to LEDs. Every LED needs a
supply rail too. This may come for a regulator or directly from an LED
driver IC.

If the flash LED binding doesn't have these, then it is only a matter of time.

>From a binding perspective, not my problem. The problem with the
driver needs driving the binding definition is the drivers can change
over time. IIRC there has been some discussion of combining the 2
subsystems in the kernel, so we don't want to create something defined
by current kernel needs.

This is along the lines I was thinking, but don't see how it is very
different at the binding level. The parent-child relationship is
typically control path or just what is downstream from the parent
device. Some bindings like GPIO and PWM don't follow this, but that is
often because they are just additional sideband interfaces on top of
the main control interface. I think simply making the "backlight" node
from the pwm-backlight binding a child works. We probably need a
different compatible string though (led-backlight is as good as
anything). I also think we should require child nodes to have a
compatible string which we didn't do for flash devices. It's probably
not too late to fix that.

I think there are 2 cases of PWM connection to LEDs to consider. The
PWM is an input to a LED driver chip or the PWM directly controls the
LED (attached to the anode). The current pwm-backlight binding covers
the latter. In the former case, pwms should probably be in the parent
(LED driver IC node). Of course, if the driver IC has no s/w
controllable interface beyond PWM, then it probably doesn't need to be
modeled at all in DT.

Yes, I think we're really only debating the structure of nodes.

I just meant the relationship of all the nodes involved.
