So I had a call with Pavel Machek, who is maintainer of the LED
subsystem, and he thinks that you should wait with the LED patches
until they are acked/reviewed by others. So if you want to send a
pull-request to Linus, you probably should remove the LED patches for
now. They can be added later when they are reviewed.

By that I mean that in my opinion the best naming scheme here would be:
  hid%d:COLOR:micmute
for micmute LED (there is LED_FUNCTION_MICMUTE constant defined in
include/dt-bindings/leds/common.h)
and
  hid%d:COLOR:player-%d
for player LEDs.

This will need adding LED_FUNCTION_PLAYER constant, which will need
sending a patch that will need to be reviewed by LED people (and
applied by Pavel). I talked with Pavel and he thinks that if there are
other HID drivers (for joysticks) that also have this kind of LEDs
(identifiing players), than such a patch would be reasonable (and those
LEDs should use the constant). Otherwise LED_FUNCTION_INDICATOR should
be probably used.
