Hi Bruce,

Because led_classdev_suspend() need to turn off LED with these API. set_brightness_delayed() is the same level API as __led_set_brightness(). No need to add LED_SUSPENDED checking as well.

Indeed, it would be even harmful with the current sequence of
instructions in the led_classdev_suspend().

So, the only action to take is to revert the commit 5ab92a7cb8.

Would you mind submitting the patch so that everyone interested
could give their ack?

Best regards,
