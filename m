Sigh. Andrew even told you it's already been merged, and _then_ you
send up a single patch pull request with _just_ this to Linus after
having been completely unresponsive for a month?

Anyway, dropped the last fixes branch from mvebu now.

Btw: Andrew, in the future it's useful to get these kind of requests
cc:d to arm@kernel.org, since I don't monitor my inbox the same way I
keep an eye on that folder. I didn't notice this until several days
later. Not your fault, but it'd help me. :-)
