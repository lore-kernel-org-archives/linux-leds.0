Cut what you need from this:
https://github.com/flosse/linuxconsole/blob/master/utils/fftest.c

If your objection is that FF is not easily engaged from the shell -
yes, but I do not think that actual users who want to do vibration do
that via shell either. On the other hand, can you drop privileges and
still allow a certain process control your vibrator via LED interface?
With FF you can pass an FD to whoever you deem worthy and later revoke
access.

IOW sysfs interfaces are nice for quick hacks, but when you want to
use them in real frameworks, where you need to think about proper
namespaces, isolation, etc, etc, other kinds of interfaces might suit
better.

I would say that while leds-gpio can be used to do whatever (you can
wire PS/2 mouse to a set of gpios and probably manage to drive it
through a set of leds-gpio devices) it does not make it right
interface for everything. We do have a standard interface for haptic
(via rumble FF), at this moment I see no reason why we need another
one. It just confuses userspace as it now needs to implement multiple
interfaces, depending on the system it runs. Android expects that HAL
will take care of hiding all of that from their upper layers and does
not really pay close attention to kernel ABIs, but I think we should.

Thanks.
