I don't have a simple answer for you...

There was a similar discussion for pm8941-wled and
"default-brightness-level" units[1]. The conclusion was it should be
units matching the h/w so that there is no conversion between
bootloader and OS units to h/w units. That principle probably applies
here.

If the brightness levels are non-linear, then you need a translation
from percent to h/w level. What's needed here for h/w levels depends
on whether the brightness control is PWM, current control or both. For
PWM, units of the PWM control makes sense. For current control, units
of microamps probably makes sense. I don't know what you do with both,
but I have seen that h/w (FSL PMICs).

This all certainly needs some more work on defining some common
binding. We already have some bindings for backlights with the LED and
PWM bindings (perhaps incomplete?). Do we need another way here? This
also introduces possibility of multiple ways to define GPIO controlled
backlights: gpio -> gpio-leds ->  led-backlight or gpio ->
gpio-backlight. We don't want that...

This problem is not really specific at all to backlights, but applies
to all LEDs. Some LEDs you may not have control beyond on/off or
really care about fine-grained control of level, but they are really
no different. The main unique thing about backlights is what display
are they associated with.
