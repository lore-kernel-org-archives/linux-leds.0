It's also good to keep in mind the workflow of driver maintainers who push
directly to Linus.  They send PRs during the merge window, and don't
necessarily spend too much time in -next.  Which means, if they have good
filters running on lkml, they just sit down a week or so before the merge
window and apply everything they have pending.

For those of us who are feeding arm-soc, and are accustomed to getting things
in early, this can be nerve-wracking.

Brian has demonstrated that he does pick things up and get them merged.  We
just need to make sure that what he picks up is well tested and reviewed when
he gets to it.  Since there won't be time for another revision before the merge
window.  But hey, that's what -rc's are for.  :-P

I agree.

thx,

Jason.
