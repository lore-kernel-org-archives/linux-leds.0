OK, I was looking at the problem from LED-centric perspective. Indeed,
backlight subsystem has no other way to pass brightness to the LED
subsystem than in the form of levels. However, the last word belongs
to DT maintainer in this matter.

For this type of drivers we have to resort to levels in DT.
It shouldn't serve as an excuse for not describing the rest of
hardware in a better way, though.
