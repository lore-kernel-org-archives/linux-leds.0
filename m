Not exactly. hid_hw_open is called whenever someone opens the hidraw or
input node (or any other resource attached to the HID device). This
starts the input reading, but also calls usb_autopm_get_interface()
which will prevent the device to be autosuspended. The drivers that call
hid_hw_open() in their probe are the ones where we know no one will open
the hidraw or input node but we need to poll for events.

Let's keep it that way then.

Why would you change the old config symbol for the existing devices. If
(and I don't think that's the best option) you were to add a new symbol,
you could use this to select between HID and USB for the new drivers:
CONFIG_USB_LED_LEGACY_SUPPORT would depend on CONFIG_USB_LED, and you
choose to enable the HID driver based on CONFIG_USB_LED_LEGACY_SUPPORT.

No. I'd rather not having the files moved around when they are KABI. So
either you add the old sysfs files directly at the same level, or you
symlink to them. Some HID driver already take a pointer to the
underlying USB device, so you can do the same.
