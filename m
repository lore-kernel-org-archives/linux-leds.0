About taking the dts part of this patch set in the led branch, I agree.
It will solve the dependency problem I would have. Usually we (the mvebu
maintainer) take all the dts related to void the merge conflict.

For these ones, I don't expect any merge problem because they are all located
in dts and only in one family.

So you can also take "[PATCH v2 2/4] ARM: Kirkwood: add modes-map property to
ns2-leds nodes" with my
Acked-by: Gregory CLEMENT <gregory.clement@free-electrons.com>

and I will remove this one from my branches.

Thanks,

Gregory

Right, I missed this third version.
