We don't want to leave decision to the user; because then we'll end up
with userland applications having to support _both_ interfaces.

Plus, it is not really your decision. Dmitry is maintainer of input
subsystem, input was doing force feedback for 10+ years, and he
already made a decision.

I agree these would be nice. Interested parties are welcome to help
there. But I don't think this should have any impact on LED
susbystem. Force feedback just does not belong to LED subsystem.
