And that's very bad idea.

As a user of these interfaces, I am telling you: I want _single_
kernel interface to control vibration. Not different interfaces
depending on which phone I'm running at.

If you want to improve input, please go ahead.

If you want to encourage haptic feedback to use LED subsystem, that is
not welcome.
