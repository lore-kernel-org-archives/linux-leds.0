Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for the inputs! Following are the reasons to go for the new 
driver
and this driver can support 5 PMICs.

1.Majority of  register, offsets and config values don’t match  up  
between
  PMI8998 and PM8941
2.Feature such as – SC protection handling in SW cannot be done for 8941 
as
there is no SC event/irq, AMOELD AVDD cannot supported by PM8941
3.Feature such as – string auto-calibration even if common will have to 
use
different offsets/registers in the same SW logic
4.PMI8998, PMI8994, PMI8950 and PM660 all of them have this same WLED 
module
(and register map) with very minor changes unlike 8941.

Thanks,
Kiran
