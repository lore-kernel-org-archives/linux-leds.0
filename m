Well, no.

Kernel is supposed to provide hardware abstraction, that means it
should hide differences between different devices.

And we already have devices using input as designed. We don't want to
have situation where "on phones A, D and E, vibrations are handled via
input, while on B, C and F, they are handled via /sys/class/leds".

If we want to have discussion "how to make vibrations in input
easier to use", well that's fair. But I don't think it is particulary hard.

If we want to say "lets move all vibrations from input to LED
subsystem"... I don't think that is good idea, but its a valid
discussion. Some good reasons would be needed.

But having half devices use one interface and half use different one
is just bad... especially when only reason to do it that way is
"David wants to do it that way, android library made a mistake and he
now wants it to propagate to whole world".

Thank you,
