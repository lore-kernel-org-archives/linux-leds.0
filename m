I agree, this is kind of weird. Maybe we should have a device-specific
attribute (on the platform device level) that allows controlling overall
brightness, but I think LEDs should be just on/off with max brightness
of 1. Userspace should not have to be aware about the fact that on that
particular device LEDs are not completely independent as far as their
brightness goes.

Thanks.
