Perhaps, if my userspace had udev. But even then, if I have to modify my
userspace in order to upgrade the kernel (which is what I'm trying to
avoid, for a number of reasons), I'd probably still do it in a
seven-line init script instead of trying to wrap my head around
udev/mdev rule writing.

Initializing the netdev trigger from DT data is certainly in line with
what is possible for certain other triggers via the led-pattern property.

Just out of curiosity, do you have a udev rule (template) for this?

Huh? I don't think there's any guarantee that the netdevice has a DT
node/phandle, and even if it did, how would the init code map from that
phandle to the string it should fill into ->device_name? Since DT
natively has bools and strings, it's much more natural to just use those
types which map nicely to the sysfs properties.

Well, this is in relation to the already linux-specific
linux,default-trigger binding. But I can certainly reword this to a
simple example that doesn't mention what it replaces and why, and just
move the mentioning of CONFIG_CAN_LEDS to the commit message.

I considered that, but rejected it because it complicates the existing
user of set_device() (where the call happens under a lock; from the
_of_init function, nobody else knows about the trigger_data instance
yet). But on second thought, I think you're right that it's better done
in that one place. So I'll refactor.

OK, will move to separate patch.
