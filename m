Hi Lee,
Thanks for the feedback! The regmap difference is not confined to couple 
of registers.
Except the one register all the registers have some difference in offset 
or bitmap or
config values as compared to the pm8941. Below is the table for the 
reference. The below
table covers only the registers those exist in the pm8941 driver, if we 
keep adding the
other features the changes may be huge. Apart from this I have mentioned 
other feature
differences between pm8941 and pm8998 as well in response to Bjorn. 
Please refer that
as well.

Register	             Compatibility between 8998 Vs 8941
========                     
===================================================
WLED_MODULE_ENABLE	       Register address offset is same and config 
values match
WLED1_ILED_SYNC_BIT	       Register address offset and config values not 
matching.
WLED1_SWITCHING_FREQUENCY      Register address offset and config values 
are matching.
                                But there is an extra override bit in 
pm8998.
WLED1_WLED_OVP	               Register address offset same. But config 
values are not matching.
WLED1_WLED_ILIM	               Register address offset is same. But 
config values are not matching
WLED1_EN_CURRENT_SINK	       Both register address offset and config 
values are not matching.
WLED1_LED1_MODULATOR_EN	       Both register address offset and config 
values are not matching.
WLED1_LED1_FULL_SCALE_CURRENT  Both register address offset and config 
values are not matching.
WLED1_LED1_MODULATOR_SRC_SE    Register address offset not matching, but 
the config values are matching
WLED1_LED1_CABC_EN	       Register address offset not matching, but the 
config values are not matching.

Thanks,
Kiran
