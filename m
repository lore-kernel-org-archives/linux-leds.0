Looks good now. Thanks!

Perhaps you can resend both patches as a series (call both v6) so it's
easy to figure which version that is to be applied.

I also noticed that your subject line is a bit long (will end up as the
commit summary). Using for example

	HID: gt683r: move mode attribute to led-class devices

would make it more concise.

Oh, and your commit message lacks line breaks (around 72 cols). You
could fix that as well.

Thanks again,
Johan
