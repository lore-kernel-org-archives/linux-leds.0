Hello Thierry,

first of all thanks for your reply.

So

Yes, it does fix a bug. Without my patch setting the brightness of the
LED in question to zero doesn't work most of the time, with my patch it
works. Also I wouldn't call it quirk as that has a negative connotation
(at least for me). I'd call it a nice feature, that is missing from the
other pwms I know, but I don't care much how you call it.

This definition doesn't fix the problem at hand. (It would fix it for
i.MX28, but not in general.) leds-pwm is doing:

	pwm_config(led_dat->pwm, new_duty, led_dat->period);
	if (new_duty =3D=3D 0)
		pwm_disable(led_dat->pwm);
	else
		pwm_enable(led_dat->pwm);

=2E The problem is not that i.MX28 takes some time until it works with =
the
new config, but that it does something on pwm_disable that the author o=
f
leds-pwm didn't take into account.
The only thing special on i.MX28 is that currently pwm_config might
return before the new config is active and that is the reason why the
state after pwm_disable is undefined for a different reason than on
other platforms (probably).

There are several things I can imagine that happen with the pin on
pwm_disable:

 - constant 0
 - constant 1
 - constant what it currently is
 - high-z

leds-pwm seems to assume the first option, the i.MX28 hardware behaves
according to the third option. I don't think either of them is an
assumption you should put in the API. I still think my suggestion is
sane.

Currently even in the presence of the mentioned problems I'd say the
i.MX28 pwm driver "conforms" to the current pwm API/documentation. The
problem is that there are some things not formalized yet. And if there
are different implementations behaving differently obviously you must
specify more details if the users of the API need more
control/information (and then fix the implementations that became wrong
by the new details and fix the users that assumed wrong).

The two changes in question here are:

 - After pwm_config returns the new setting must already be active.
   This would result in the need to add a delay to the mxs-pwm driver
   (and maybe others). There is probably no need to fix users.
   I'm not yet convinced that this specification is necessary, at least
   it didn't bite yet and I cannot imagine a use case where it would
   matter.
 - Explicitly make the state of the pwm pin after pwm_disable
   implementation defined.
   There is probably no need to fix implementers, but at least leds-pwm
   as suggested in my patches.

Best regards
Uwe
