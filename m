OK, I did not know that that was Linus' request, my objection still
stands.

OK, that sounds better. Actually, we already have
fwnode_get_named_gpiod(), unfortunately it does not do suffixes
permutations. There are also no users, except
devm_get_gpiod_from_child(). So I would:

- rename fwnode_get_named_gpiod() -> static __fwnode_get_named_gpiod()
- made new fwnode_get_named_gpiod() that did suffix permutation and
  called __fwnode_get_named_gpiod() (or pulled its implementation
  inline)
- renamed devm_get_gpiod_from_child() ->
  devm_fwnode_get_named_gpiod(dev, fwnode, con_id)
  and called fwnode_get_named_gpiod().

This would indeed match the pattern with other fwnode/property handling
APIs.

Thanks.
