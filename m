OK, I see. I wondered how we could do that in device tree.

If I'm going to use the new-style bindings, then I'll need to convert
common.txt over to use the new format as well so that the automated
schema validations will work. I'm willing to do that work if there is
interest from the LED / backlight maintainers. The main issue is that
there are 62 references to the file common.txt in the directory
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/. Would the maintainers prefer:

- Once common.txt is converted to common.yaml, make common.txt only
  have a line stating that the common bindings were moved into
  common.yaml. We can remove this file once all of the other bindings
  are converted to the new-style format.

- Update all references to common.txt to common.yaml. (1 patch or 62
  patches?)

- Or, just go with the older-style binding format for now.

Thanks Dan for your other comments. They make sense and I'll incorporate
those changes into my next version.

Brian
