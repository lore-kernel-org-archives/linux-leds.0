If you implemented brightness_get op it would show proper value.
Assuming that the device allows reading current brightness.

This way we are removing the possibility of controlling LED brightness
at all, the feature that the hardware supports. Anyway, we will have to
add a mechanism to the LED subsystem for detecting which LED class
devices are controlled by the same hardware. This will allow for
describing this type of dependencies. This is on "to do" list.
