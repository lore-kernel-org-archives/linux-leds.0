I don't think we should be fixing it at trigger level.

If userspace keeps blinking using "brightness" attribute, would we
like the LED to be off during suspend? I think so.

No, leave the timer alone, and actually leave the trigger alone.

Simply make the driver turn the LED off in .suspend() callback, and
then ignore further requests until .resume(). That will get rid of
power drain _and_ "failed I2C transaction" messages, right?

(Actually, I tested with the heartbeat trigger, and it is not
re-installed after resume. Another reason to revert the patch).

Thanks,
