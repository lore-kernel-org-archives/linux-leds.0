I think we can go in this direction. I've skimmed through existing
class drivers and found similar examples (e.g. tty_class, rtc_class).

OK, I confused something here. Backlight driver should depend on
LEDS_CLASS by defining "depends on LEDS_CLASS" in backlight Kconfig.
It should also depend on OF. In case of this driver the no-ops would be
only for the purpose of making the kernel image smaller, as the driver
probe will fail without them anyway. Nevertheless, there might be added
other drivers in the future, using of_led_get{put} API which would like
to make some decisions basing on whether LEDS_CLASS or/and OF are
turned on. No-ops would be of use then.

I used 'waste' because we would be wasting time here for the call which
can be avoided at no cost. Of course if compiler will decide to inline
it.

Why so?

There is the tradeoff. Readability vs performance.

That's why we inline only small functions.

We could include module.h from leds.h.
