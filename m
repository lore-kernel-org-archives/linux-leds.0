Unpredictable device names is not a problem I'm trying to solve, nor one
that actually occurs on embedded systems. And even if one has such a
system, one is likely running udev or similar to rename devices to
something sane and predictable, in which case a fixed string _still_
works fine. Or one uses udev rules to munge the netdev trigger sysfs
files, and has applications dealing with devices appearing as banana457.

OK, so there's of_find_net_device_by_node, so a phandle solution might
also be possible, and might work just as well for my case. But I still
think initializing with a fixed string is the simplest and sanest thing
to do.
