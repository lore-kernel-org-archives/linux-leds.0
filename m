TBH I haven't thought of that. My initial idea was to actually offer
maximum flexibility to the user, so exposing all block devices on the
system [*], being able to set any LED available as an indicator for each
of those.

But, indeed, just using ledtrig-disk in NVMe and SD might just be
simpler.


[*] - again, I see now this was a bad idea and will be changed in a
possible next version
