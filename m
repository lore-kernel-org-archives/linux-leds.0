I've just noticed that we have drivers/leds/leds-netxbig.c driver, which
also doesn't allow controlling the LEDs on extension board individually,
but it still does allow changing their brightness. I am leaning towards
allowing this also for this driver and adding similar comment in the
source code like at the line 218 of the aforementioned driver.
As a result this property wouldn't be required.
