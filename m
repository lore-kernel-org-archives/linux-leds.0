Yes, i can change this, hard code tio 8/16 in the structure, and use
TLC591XX_MAX_LEDS.

Adding the 08 support made this grow with more shared properties.  It
probably is now time to have a common part and a per LED part.

Actually, i would remove this check altogether. This cannot be
influenced outside the driver, so if it is not _DIM or BLANK, it is an
internal driver bug.

include/linux/leds.h says:

        /* Must not sleep, use a workqueue if needed */
        void            (*brightness_set)(struct led_classdev *led_cdev,
                                          enum led_brightness brightness);

and regmap uses a lock to protect its structures, and so does i2c, etc.

Only if the core is broken. From include/linux/leds.h

enum led_brightness {
        LED_OFF         = 0,
        LED_HALF        = 127,
        LED_FULL        = 255,
};

I suppose led->ldev.brightness could change value between the switch
and the call to tlc591xx_set_pwm. I can take a local copy and use
that.

Yes, it would, but i'm not sure that is any better. At the moment it
is a constant, so the compiler can optimise it. We might save 8
iterations for TLC59108, but how much do we add by having less well
optimized code? And this is during probe, not some hot path, so do we
really care?

It would be very odd. The fact the probe function is being called
means there is a match. So return values like -ENODEV would mean a
core OF bug. There is no memory allocations needed, so -ENOMEM would
also not be expected.

How can it be NULL? If the probe has been called, it means the
compatibility string must match. If it matches, there must be a np!

Anyway, of_get_child_count() looks to be happy with NULL and will
return 0.
