I would like to know more about why you find the FF interface hard,
given that for rumble you need calls - one ioctl to set up rumble
parameters, and a write to start the playback. The FF core should take
care of handling duration of the effect, ramping it up and decaying,
if desired, and we make sure to automatically stop effects when
userspace closes the fd (because of ordinary exit or crash or FD being
revoked).

Completely agree here. I just merged PWM vibra driver from Sebastian
Reichel, we already had regulator-haptic driver, do we need gpio-based
one? Or make regulator-based one working with fixed regulators?

Thanks.
